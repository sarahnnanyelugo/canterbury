              Founded in 1915 and guided by our Catholic heritage, Canterbury is
              a college preparatory, coeducational boarding and day school for
              students in grades 9–12. The School prides itself on creating a
              community based on its Five Values—Honesty, Respect, Compassion,
              Spirituality, and Self Reliance—in which students and faculty
              forge lasting bonds and every student experiences a broad and
              challenging program in a small school setting. The School’s
              educational environment fosters academic rigor, athletic
              development, artistic enrichment, and spiritual growth, and
              strives to ensure a superior experience that prepares students for
              leading colleges and universities and for life.

                The most remarkable and differentiating aspect of small boarding
                schools is that they value the equal importance of academic
                success, personal growth, and community engagement when it comes
                to learning, living, and leading.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that Canterbury is<em> the best</em> small boarding
                school.
