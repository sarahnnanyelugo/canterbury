              Canterbury is an independent, coeducational boarding and day
              school for grades 9–12 and postgraduates. Yet, it's more than a
              school, more than a place. It's a promise grounded in our belief
              in your extraordinary potential.

              Founded in 1915 and set on a hilltop in New Milford, Connecticut,
              Canterbury combines a strong tradition of academic excellence with
              a commitment to nurturing intellectually curious, values-centered,
              well-rounded students. Within an inclusive, interfaith community
              guided by a Catholic heritage, students become empathetic,
              ethically grounded individuals who value diversity and are
              inspired to create a more just and compassionate world.{" "}

              With approximately 330 students, we are committed to the small
              boarding school experience as the most comprehensive form of high
              school education—for day and boarding students alike. A rigorous
              college preparatory curriculum, robust extracurricular offerings,
              and engaged community life allow for growth and discovery in every
              dimension. Our faculty, at the heart of these experiences, meet
              students where they are and champion everything they aspire to
              become.
